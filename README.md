Software Engineer | Go, TypeScript, Python | Building systems from first principles

## About

I build tools and systems to understand how they work under the hood. My projects span distributed systems, database internals, compilers, and developer tooling. I write about what I learn on [Medium](https://medium.com/@utkarshpriyadarshi5026).
